# pfSense 2.7.2 on VMware
This repository contains a detailed guide on installing and configuring pfSense 2.7.2 on VMware Workstation/ESXi for a robust firewall solution.

## Prerequisites
- VMware Workstation/ESXi
- pfSense 2.7.2 ISO
- 2GB RAM, 20GB disk (minimum for pfSense)
- Basic knowledge of networking

## Key Features
- Setting up NAT and firewall rules
- Configuring DHCP and DNS services
- Enabling VPN functionality

 ### 1. Overview of pfSense 2.7.2 ###
Because of its adaptability, pfSense, an open-source firewall and router platform based on FreeBSD, is often used in both home and business networks.
This tutorial will cover the first setup stages and show you how to install pfSense 2.7.2 on a VMware virtual machine.


### 2. Downloading pfSense 2.7.2 ###
First, download the pfSense installer from the official pfSense website: https://www.pfsense.org/download/

Architecture: Select “AMD64” for modern 64-bit systems.
Installer Type: Choose the “ISO Installer” for use with VMware.
Mirror: Select a mirror close to your location for faster download.
Once downloaded, you can use this ISO to create a virtual machine in VMware.


### 3. Installation Process in VMware ###
After downloading the ISO file, follow these steps to set up a virtual machine in VMware:

### 1. Create a New Virtual Machine : ###

Open VMware and click Create a New Virtual Machine.
Choose Typical configuration for simplicity.
Select the Installer disc image file (ISO) option, and browse to the downloaded pfSense ISO.

### 2. VMware Configuration ### :

Name the virtual machine (e.g., pfSense_VM).

###   3. Network Layout: ###

Put two network adapters in the VMware configurations.

One for the WAN interface—set "Bridged" or "NAT," depending on your network.

One for the LAN interface, designated "Host-only" to keep it apart from the outside network).

 ###  4.Start the virtual machine then install pfSense: ###

You will get the pfSense installation when boot the VM.
Out of the menu, choose " Install pfSense".
Unless you want a special setup, select the Auto (ZFS) for disk partitioning.
